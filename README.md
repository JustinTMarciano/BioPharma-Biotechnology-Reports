# Equity Research & Biotech Analysis Portfolio
### A Collection of My Investment Theses

---

### 1. Mission Statement & Analytical Philosophy

This repository serves as a professional portfolio of my independent equity research, focusing on deep, fundamental analysis of publicly-traded companies, primarily within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors.

My analytical philosophy is grounded in a rigorous, evidence-based approach that seeks to identify a quantifiable "edge" against the market's prevailing sentiment. I believe that a superior understanding of clinical data, regulatory pathways, and market dynamics can lead to the identification of mispriced securities.

All analyses are structured using an **institutional equity research (ER) framework**, designed to deliver a clear, actionable, and data-driven investment thesis.

### 2. Core Methodologies & Differentiators

While each report is tailored to a specific company and catalyst, my analysis is consistently built upon a core set of proprietary and professional-grade frameworks:

#### **Probabilistic Catalyst Analysis**
For binary, catalyst-driven events (e.g., PDUFA decisions, pivotal trial readouts), I employ a multi-stage process:
1.  **Benchmarking the Market:** I first use options market data (delta, volatility skew) to derive the objective, market-implied probability of an event's success. This serves as the baseline to beat.
2.  **Bottom-Up Fundamental Modeling:** I then build a proprietary, weighted-factor model to derive a fundamental probability from the ground up. This involves a deep dive into:
    *   **Scientific & Clinical Data:** Mechanism of Action (MOA), Phase 1-3 trial results, statistical significance (p-values), and clinical meaningfulness.
    *   **Regulatory & Safety Hurdles:** Scrutiny of safety & tolerability profiles, manufacturing (CMC) risk, and historical FDA precedent.
3.  **Identifying the "Edge":** The final output is the quantifiable difference between my fundamental probability and the market's implied odds, which forms the core of the investment thesis.

#### **Valuation & Financial Modeling**
For broader company analyses, I utilize a range of valuation techniques appropriate for the sector, including:
*   Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Valuation
*   Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
*   Precedent Transaction & Comparable Company Analysis
*   Risk-Adjusted Net Present Value (rNPV)

### 3. Portfolio of Reports

This section contains a curated list of my completed analyses. Each report is a self-contained, professional-grade product.

*   **[Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) - An Analysis of Tail Risk & Valuation Floor (August 2025)](/Sarepta-Elevidys-Analysis.pdf)**
    *   **Description:** A deep dive into Sarepta's Elevidys franchise following an 87% YTD share price collapse, dissecting the clinical data, adverse safety events, and regulatory fallout that triggered a market crisis.
    *   **Methodology:** Hybrid DCF and Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) valuation.
    *   **Conclusion:** **Buy rating with a ~$34 price target.** The analysis concludes that the market has more than fully priced in a near-worst-case scenario, with the stable PMO franchise providing a tangible valuation floor at a point of maximum pessimism.

*   **[Arvinas. Inc, - Postmortem on a PROTAC Pioneer: The 
Vepdegestrant Phase III Failure (Seeptember 2025)](/EquityResearch-ArvinasPostmortem.pdf)**
    *   **Description:** A forensic analysis of vepdegestrant, Arvinas's lead PROTAC degrader, following the failure of its pivotal Phase III VERITAC-2 trial. This report dissects the disconnect between the drug's scientific hypothesis and its flawed molecular properties, concluding the failure was due to poor medicinal chemistry and pharmacokinetics.
    *   **Methodology:** A fundamental, DCF-based valuation to establish a post-failure floor valuation.
    *   **Conclusion:** **Hold Rating with an ~$8.00 Price Target.** The analysis concludes this was a molecule-specific failure and that the market is now appropriately pricing ARVN as a specialty commercial asset-backed company.

*   **UPCOMING[Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) - Donidalorsen PDUFA Analysis (August 2025)](/IONS_Donidalorsen_PDUFA)**
    *   **Description:** A deep dive into the upcoming FDA decision for Ionis's HAE drug, Donidalorsen.
    *   **Methodology:** Probabilistic catalyst analysis.
    *   **Conclusion:** Bullish. The analysis derived a fundamental probability of approval of 68.85%, representing a significant edge over the market's implied probability of ~58%.
